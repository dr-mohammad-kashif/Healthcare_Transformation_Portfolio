# HL7 – An Overview

HL7, or Health Level Seven, is one of the most fundamental standards in healthcare information technology. In theory, it is a common language that enables messages between different hospital information systems. Every healthcare organization has different systems, such as registration software for personal data, laboratory information systems with test results, radiology information systems with imaging studies, pharmacy databases with prescriptions, and the central Electronic Medical Record system. Without a unified standard, these systems encode and transmit data in various forms; hence, coordination is tough to achieve, with a higher potential for misalignment. HL7 resolves this issue by specifying explicit formats for the structure, organization, and transmission of patient information.

This structure begs the question: what do HL7 messages look like? HL7 messages are composed of units called segments, each containing a specific data type. If a patient is admitted or discharged, for example, an ADT message is sent. ADT stands for Admission, Discharge and Transfer; this message serves to notify integrated systems regarding the status change of the patient. Another example involves the results of tests from a Medical Laboratory. Once testing is complete, an ORU message is generated. ORU means Observation Result, and it conveys the test results back to the EMR to be reviewed by the clinician. The use of standard message formats ensures that messages between systems using HL7 communicate in a non-varying fashion, leading to fewer errors.

This is a key guideline in fulfilling the requirements of interoperability. Interoperability refers to the ability of different health information systems to understand one another and contribute or share information. With HL7, the rate of errors involved in manual data entry is reduced; patient workflows are better managed; and clinicians have timely access to precise reports. While modern standards like FHIR are beginning to be in greater use, the older HL7 infrastructure provides support for basic functions globally in many hospitals when digital records are transferred.
