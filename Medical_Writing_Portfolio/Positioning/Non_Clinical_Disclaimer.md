## Non-Clinical Scope & Disclaimer

The work described here is intended to be strictly non-clinical in nature. My focus is on healthcare data interpretation and medical communication for informational or educational use, not on clinical decision-making or patient care. Nothing produced should be understood as medical advice or used to guide diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis.

This scope is intended for use by health-tech teams, analytics and product groups, and education or research-oriented organizations that deal with healthcare information but are not involved in direct clinical delivery. The role I am pursuing is centered on explaining and organizing complex medical or healthcare-related material so that non-clinical stakeholders can understand it more clearly.

I do not provide individualized medical guidance, and I do not engage in patient interaction of any kind. I am not involved in treatment planning, care coordination, or clinical judgment. Any explanations or summaries are limited to high-level context and are meant to support understanding, not decision-making.

I also do not prepare or submit documents for regulatory approval. This includes formal submissions to bodies such as the FDA, EMA, or similar authorities. I do not certify compliance, validate regulatory accuracy, or assume responsibility for regulatory outcomes.

When working with healthcare data, I follow basic data-privacy principles aligned with frameworks such as HIPAA and GDPR. For examples, demonstrations, or portfolio work, I rely only on de-identified, aggregated, or publicly available datasets. I do not access or handle protected health information or personally identifiable data.

All material is provided for informational purposes only. Final interpretation, application, and responsibility remain with appropriately qualified clinical, regulatory, or operational professionals. This disclaimer is intended to clearly define the boundaries of the non-clinical healthcare work I am pursuing.

## What I Do

1. Explain healthcare-related data, reports, and documentation in clear, non-clinical language for informational and educational use.

2. Interpret high-level medical or clinical concepts to help non-clinical teams understand context, assumptions, and limitations.

3. Translate complex healthcare information into structured summaries, briefs, or explainer content for internal communication.

4. Contextualize healthcare data by highlighting what the information shows, what it does not show, and where misinterpretation can occur.

5. Support internal learning, documentation, and knowledge-sharing efforts within health-tech, analytics, and research-oriented teams.

## What I Do Not Do

1. I do not provide medical advice, diagnoses, treatment recommendations, or prognostic opinions for individuals.

2. I do not interact with patients or participate in patient care, care coordination, or clinical decision-making.

3. I do not author, submit, or sign off on documents intended for formal regulatory review or approval.

4. I do not enter, modify, or validate information within live electronic health records or clinical systems.

5. I do not assume responsibility for clinical outcomes, regulatory outcomes, or patient-level decisions.
