# HL7 – A Simple Explainer 

HL7 - sometimes known as Health Level Seven - is a really important standard in healthcare tech. To understand it, think of it as a common language allowing different hospital systems to share data with each other. Healthcare centers run multiple distinct systems: registration software handling personal information, lab setups managing test reports, radiology systems storing scans, pharmacy databases tracking prescriptions, along with the main “Electronic Medical Record”, known as EMRs. In the absence of a common standard, every system might save and share data differently, causing major coordination issues between the different systems. HL7 addresses this issue by creating clear formats for structuring, organizing and sending patient details.

It leads to a question. What does an HL7 messages look like? HL7 messages are made up of sections called “segments” and each one of these segments contain a specific kind of data. For example, let’s take a patient admission or discharge - during such events, an ADT message gets sent. This acronym “ADT” means Admission, Discharge and Transfer. The job ADT does is informing linked systems about changes in patient status. Another example is lab findings from a Medical Lab. Once the test results are ready, the system generates an ORU message instead. “ORU” means Observation Result; this delivers lab findings into the EMR for physician evaluation. Since such messages follow fixed formats, platforms using HL7 share information consistently instead of creating errors.

This guideline is key for achieving interoperability. Interoperability, in a nutshell means that different health systems can understand each other and an exchange of information is possible between them. Because of HL7, mistakes from hand-entered or manual records drop considerably, patient workflows move faster, while physicians gain timely access to accurate reports. Although modern formats such as FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) are rising in use, this older framework still supports core operations in global hospital networks when transferring digital records.
