# Plain-Language Health Translation Sample on Diabetes

## Before (Clinical / Technical Version)

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Insulin is a hormone produced by pancreatic beta cells that facilitates glucose uptake into peripheral tissues for energy utilization. In type 1 diabetes, autoimmune destruction of beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, whereas type 2 diabetes involves a combination of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Prolonged hyperglycemia contributes to microvascular and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and increased susceptibility to infections. Glycemic dysregulation is influenced by genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and metabolic stress, making diabetes a condition that requires long-term monitoring and management.


## After (Plain-Language Version)

Diabetes is a chronic condition that impacts how your body processes sugar in your blood. Your body uses sugar for energy; however, to do so, it requires assistance to transfer it from the blood into your body's cells. The hormone that provides that assistance is insulin.

Some individuals' bodies produce very little insulin, while others have insulin but it functions less effectively than it should. When either of these occurs, sugar cannot be utilized by the body for energy and therefore remains in the blood. Prolonged exposure to elevated blood sugar levels may silently harm many areas of your body.

When elevated blood glucose levels are sustained for extended periods, they may negatively impact the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Many times, these changes occur gradually and may not be accompanied by identifiable symptoms initially. Diabetes is influenced by an assortment of factors, including your family's genetic background, your lifestyle, and how well your body manages stress and meets its energy requirements. As such, diabetes is commonly viewed as a chronic condition that will require your continued interest and attention versus an acute problem.

## Changes

1. *Hyperglycemia*, *insulin resistance*, and *microvascular complications* were replaced with common terminology.
2. How insulin and blood glucose interact biologically were maintained without specific details about the technical aspects of the interaction.
3. Treatments, targets, or recommendations were omitted to prevent the provision of medical advice.
4. The focus on disease classification was changed to a general understanding of the way that diabetes impacts your body over time.
