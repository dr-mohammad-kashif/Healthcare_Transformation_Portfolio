# Plain-Language Health Translation Sample on Diabetes

## Before (Clinical / Technical Version)

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Insulin is a hormone produced by pancreatic beta cells that facilitates glucose uptake into peripheral tissues for energy utilization. In type 1 diabetes, autoimmune destruction of beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency, whereas type 2 diabetes involves a combination of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Prolonged hyperglycemia contributes to microvascular and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and increased susceptibility to infections. Glycemic dysregulation is influenced by genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and metabolic stress, making diabetes a condition that requires long-term monitoring and management.


## After (Plain-Language Version)

Diabetes is a long-term condition that affects how the body handles sugar in the blood. Sugar is one of the main sources of energy for the body, but it needs help to move from the bloodstream into cells. That help comes from a hormone called insulin.

In some people, the body makes very little or no insulin. In others, insulin is present but does not work as effectively as it should. When this happens, sugar stays in the blood instead of being used for energy. Over time, higher than normal sugar levels can quietly strain different parts of the body.

If blood sugar remains high for long periods, it can affect the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. These changes usually develop slowly and may not cause noticeable symptoms at first. Diabetes is influenced by a mix of factors, including family history, daily habits, and how the body responds to stress and energy demands. Because of this, it is generally considered a long-term condition that needs ongoing attention rather than a short-term problem.


## Changes

1. Medical terms such as *hyperglycemia*, *insulin resistance*, and *microvascular complications* were replaced with everyday language.
2. The core biological idea of how insulin and blood sugar interact was preserved without technical detail.
3. Specific treatments, targets, or recommendations were intentionally left out to avoid medical advice.
4. The focus was shifted from disease classification to general understanding of how the condition affects the body over time.
