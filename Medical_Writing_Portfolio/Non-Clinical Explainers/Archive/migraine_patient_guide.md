# Migraines: A Clear Overview For Patients

A migraine is much more than just a headache – It is a chronic disorder of the brain; causing recurrent episodes of varying degrees of discomfort. So many patients report experiencing such significant distress from this condition that it affects their ability to do work, spend time with loved ones, or perform routine tasks. Not only is the pain level that occurs during a migraine episode different from that experienced by those who have headaches – but also the accompanying symptoms can be overwhelming. The pain is typically described as a pulsating, throbbing sensation, and is initially unilateral (on one side) before eventually radiating bilaterally (across both sides). Nausea and vomiting are very common during the onset of a migraine episode, as well as sensitivity to light, noise, and smell. Even ordinary lighting or conversation may be too much for someone experiencing a migraine episode. As far as why we get migraines – it is due to how our brains operate; it has nothing to do with weakness, stress, or being overly sensitive.

If left untreated or poorly managed, the effects of migraines can affect all aspects of a person's life - including their relationship with others, and their overall health.

## Which signs could show up?

A person's experience of a migraine is always unique, but some common symptoms that people report include:

Headaches with a pulsing or throbbing sensation (that may be mild or severe) that may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

Photophobia (discomfort when exposed to bright lights), and Phonophobia (discomfort when hearing loud noises).

Blurred vision, dizziness and/or difficulties concentrating or staying focused.

Some people will notice differences prior to experiencing their migraine (like a "warning sign") - for example, a feeling of being normal, followed by an abrupt shift in their emotional state.

Sudden cravings for foods that they normally would not eat.

Feeling extremely fatigued beyond what is normal, frequent yawning, and visual disturbances (for example flashing lights in your field of vision) can all be early indicators of an impending migraine episode.

Visual disturbances may also occur during a migraine episode due to an aura.

These visual disturbances can include: flashes of light in your visual field, jagged zig-zag lines that seem to move across your visual field, and blind spots that appear in your visual field.

## Triggers Of Migraine Episodes

In addition to the "aura" or "signal" associated with the beginning of a migraine episode (which varies among patients), there are several triggers that have been identified as contributing to the initiation of a migraine episode in some patients. These include: Skipping meals or going long periods without eating, Stress or anxiety, Bright lighting (including flickering fluorescent lights), Loud or sudden noises, Pungent odors (such as perfume, cologne, cigarette smoke), Certain types of food or drink (such as chocolate, blue cheeses, processed snack foods, coffee, red wine), Hormonal changes (especially during the menstrual cycle). Understanding the causes of your migraines will enable you to avoid potential triggers, thereby reducing the frequency of episodes.

## When Do I Need To Get Immediate Medical Attention?

The majority of headaches will create some level of discomfort, however, most are non-threatening and do not need medical treatment. However, there are some headache-related symptoms that may require immediate medical evaluation or consultation. If you experience:

A sudden onset of an intense headache (that has never occurred before)

Fever in conjunction with a headache.

Neck stiffness, confusion or a rash on the body.

A headache immediately after receiving a head injury.

Numbness or tingling sensations only on one side of your body.

Difficulty speaking, understanding others, or seeing clearly.

Vomiting continuously.

In these instances, it is essential that you seek immediate medical attention or contact your healthcare provider immediately. Your symptoms may indicate a stroke, infection, or other emergency condition that requires immediate medical attention.

## Migraine Treatment Methods

The main elements to consider for treatment of migraines depend on the frequency of the headache and its intensity/severity. A physician will first prescribe medication that will help alleviate headache pain and/or minimize the severity of the headache. As a second-line approach, if a person suffers from frequent/regular migraine attacks, the doctor may also recommend a preventive type of medication to reduce the number of migraine attacks that the individual experiences. Nausea is a very common symptom associated with migraines (as previously discussed). For this reason, a physician may also provide anti-nausea medications in addition to treatment for the vomiting. The patient should discuss with the physician any potential drug interactions and/or side effects when initiating/stopping medication to avoid developing rebound headaches. Rebound headaches are headaches that occur due to excessive usage of over-the-counter pain relievers and result in more headaches, rather than providing relief from them.

## Daily Lifestyle Choices That May Reduce Migraines

Many individuals find that by combining daily habits with medication can significantly improve overall health. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, sleeping at approximately the same hour each night and waking up at roughly the same hour each morning when possible, is one way to establish consistency. Maintaining a balanced diet and eating meals at the same time each day is another habit that is beneficial. Drinking plenty of fluids during the day can also help to alleviate some migraine symptoms. By taking regular breaks from digital devices, reducing exposure to light wherever possible, exploring various relaxation techniques and engaging in breathing exercises (such as slow, deep breathing), gentle stretching or a brief walk outside can all help to ease symptoms of a migraine. Additionally, avoiding known migraine triggers is just as important as establishing a consistent routine. Over time, many people have reported that making small changes to their daily routines has resulted in less frequent/milder migraines.

## Keeping a Migraine Diary is an Excellent Way To Manage Your Migraines

Keeping a diary of your migraines is another good option for managing them. Each episode should be recorded with a simple method of documenting the event. Most importantly, document the exact time that the migraine started. Documenting your pain levels (1-10) will help you identify any patterns. Document all possible causes of your migraine (e.g., food, stress). Document whether you are sensitive to light or noise during the episode. Document which medications provided some relief (even just a little). Document both the number of hours or minutes the migraine lasted. Bringing these documents to your doctor's appointments may significantly enhance your health care. You may also have your doctor make changes based upon the patterns documented in your journal entries.

## THE FINAL WORD

Although many people are affected by migraine, most can successfully manage their symptoms using common sense modifications. If you experience headaches frequently, or they become severe, consult with a health care provider to determine the cause. Identifying your trigger(s) early in the process, while developing your own set of practices, will greatly improve your overall well being. These modifications will greatly reduce the severity of your headaches over time.
