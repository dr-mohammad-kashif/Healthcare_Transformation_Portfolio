# HealthCare Transformation Portfolio – Dr. Mohammad Kashif (MD)

I am delighted to introduce you to my healthtech data and medical writing transformation portfolio.

I am a **Medical Doctor (MD)**, and I am now developing a hybrid career in **Healthcare Data, Health Informatics, Clinical Documentation, Medical Writing, and Digital Health Product Development**.

Over time, I will continue to grow and add additional structured projects to this repository using SQL, Python, Power BI, HL7/FHIR, HealthTech content, NPHIES/RCM workflow, and medical writing.

- **Python for Health Data** — This area will focus on my ability to clean, process and analyze large amounts of data from patient visits, and the ability to identify errors and discrepancies in the data.(ongoing)
- **Power BI Dashboards** — I am planning to create sample dashboards that provide KPI's for clinics and visualizations to help monitor and improve the flow of patients through the outpatient department (OPD).(ongoing)
- **Tableau Projects** - I will be focusing on building/manipulating Dashboards and visual Analytics Projects.
- **HealthTech Content** — The focus here is going to be on my development of content related to NPHIES, ICD-10-AM, UCAF/DCAF and the use of KPI's in the Ada'a. (ongoing)
- **FHIR/Hl7 Interoperability** — I am planning to work on creating mock bundles, sending HL7 messages, mapping HL7 messages to FHIR resources.(ongoing)
