# Healthcare Transformation Portfolio – Dr. Mohammad Kashif (MD)

Welcome to my HealthTech, Data, and Medical Writing transformation portfolio.

I am a **Medical Doctor (MD)**, currently building a hybrid career across **Health Informatics, Healthcare Data, Clinical Documentation, Medical Writing, and Digital Health Product Development**.

This repository will expand with time as I complete structured projects in SQL, Python, Power BI, HL7/FHIR, HealthTech content, NPHIES/RCM workflow, and medical writing.

##  Core Tracks (My Master Plan)

This portfolio is built around six growth tracks:

- **SQL & Databases** — Healthcare datasets, joins, queries, mini-projects  
- **Python for Health Data** — cleaning, wrangling, visit analytics, quality checks  
- **Power BI Dashboards** — clinic KPIs, OPD flow, NPHIES/RCM visuals  
- **HealthTech Content** — NPHIES, ICD-10-AM, UCAF/DCAF, Ada’a KPIs  
- **FHIR / HL7 Interoperability** — mock bundles, HL7 messages, mappings  
- **Medical Writing Portfolio** — clinical, scientific, bilingual, technical HealthTech writing  

This structure acts as a skeleton and a guideline for all of my current goals in this portfolio.
